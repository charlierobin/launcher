# Letâ€™s Do Launch
## A simple launcher app for OSX.

All the app launchers and Finder dock enhancements out there are way more than I need: I just wanted simple app(s) that could each be configured with their own icons in the dock, and which would show a simple floating window when opened/activated, and then hide themselves once a button in the window had been clicked. And nothing out there seemed to do this simple thing.

So I knocked this up.

It's years old, and because I wrote it just for myself, it's no doubt missing a few bells and whistles that would improve it. But it always did just what I wanted from it, no more and no less.

I've gone through it and tried to tidy up the worst bits. It still works on my Catalina install (10.15.7), although admittedly I have all the security stuff turned off.

I've not tested it on more modern versions of macOS, and I suspect it wouldn't work, as the security/sandboxing requirements from Apple have only got more and more onerous as time has passed.

(Remember when Apple advertising mocked Microsoft for the number of times security dialog boxes would pop up in Windows? Bet that doesn't seem as funny now...)
